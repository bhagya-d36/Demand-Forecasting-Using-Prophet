    "The dataset containing can enhance the forecasting accuracy of the Prophet demand prediction time series model by providing valuable contextual data to refine the predictions for product and size-specific sales. The number of students, such as 3498 for Mt Albert Grammar School, can be used as an external regressor to reflect the potential demand driven by school population size, allowing the model to better capture variations in sales for specific items. Additionally, aligning the model with the \"Years Level Catered\" can help incorporate academic cycles, such as increased demand at the start of the school year, into the seasonality component. While the gender data indicates that all the schools are co-ed, it could still be explored for subtle demand trends since the product lines vary by gender."
